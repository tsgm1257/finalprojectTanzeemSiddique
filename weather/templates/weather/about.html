    <p>
        This web application was created as a final project for the course <strong>INF601 - Advanced Programming in Python</strong>
        by <strong>Tanzeem Siddique</strong>. The goal of this project is to integrate real-world data using an API and generate useful
        suggestions for end users using the Django web framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        The app allows users to enter any city name and fetch real-time weather information using the <strong>OpenWeatherMap API</strong>
        (accessed via <strong>RapidAPI</strong>). Based on the temperature and weather condition, it provides a personalized clothing recommendation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users can register or log in to save their searches and rate the clothing suggestions. A personal dashboard called <em>My Ratings</em>
        is available where users can review all their previous ratings and feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application is built using <strong>Django</strong> and styled with <strong>Bootstrap</strong> for responsive and user-friendly design.
        A Bootstrap modal is used to enhance interactivity when users rate their suggestions.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project demonstrates the use of Django models, forms, views, templates, authentication, third-party APIs, and Bootstrap components
        to create a full-stack, data-driven web application.
