## Description

This project is a Django-based web application that recommends clothing to users based on real-time weather conditions using the OpenWeatherMap API (via RapidAPI). Users can input a location, receive clothing suggestions based on weather data, and rate the recommendations. It includes a complete login and registration system, a "My Ratings" history page, and Bootstrap styling with modal usage.

### Key features include:

* **Weather Lookup:** Users can input any city to fetch live weather data and get a clothing recommendation.
* **Clothing Recommendation:** Suggestions are based on weather temperature and conditions (rain, cold, etc.).
* **User Ratings:** After receiving a suggestion, users can rate and provide feedback on its accuracy or usefulness.
* **Login and Registration:** Includes both combined and separate pages for user login and registration.
* **User Logout:** Logged-in users can securely log out from the navigation bar.
* **My Ratings:** Users can view a history of all their past ratings and feedback.
* **Django Admin:** Admins can manage users, preferences, and ratings through Djangoâ€™s admin interface.
* **Bootstrap Integration:** The app uses Bootstrap for responsive design and includes a modal confirmation popup after rating submission.
